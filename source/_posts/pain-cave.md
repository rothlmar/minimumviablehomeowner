Some people want to have a man cave in their home with a big TV, comfortable seating, and lots of snacks.  I spend more time in the pain cave (also known as a workout room), which a smaller TV, uncushioned seats on a bike and a rowing machine, and a few power bars and energy gels that I’m saving for future events.  We’ve had the room outfitted since we first moved in, but my usage has increased in the past twenty months, first as I was working from home during recovery and rehabilitation from my knee injury, then as the pandemic spread throughout the world and I returned to working from home just a few weeks after I had started regularly going into the office again.

I enjoy the grind and can train for months on end with no particular goal in mind, other than seeing my progress on Strava and in the Concept2 rankings.  Sometimes I pursue a nebulous idea for a solo challenge that pushes me to the limit, as long as I don’t have to increase my training time commitment too much.  For my birthday, I decided to row a marathon distance, which required nine round trips on our lake that’s only one and a half miles long.  Sometimes I’m also inspired and motivated by the prospect of a competition.  When a series about Eco-Challenge: Fiji showed up in the midst of the pandemic, my interest in adventure racing was quickly piqued.  Starting off with a multi-day endurance race seemed too ambitious, but a four or eight hour sprint race didn’t seem like enough, so I started researching twenty-four hour events.  Jenny strongly encouraged me not to race alone, so I reached out to my siblings and found a willing teammate in John.  We identified a race in Virginia, not too far from where he lives, but I dragged my feet and the entries filled up before I submitted the application.  Luckily, we were able to find a different event nearby just a few weeks later: the Conquer the Mountain race hosted by Bryce ski resort.
