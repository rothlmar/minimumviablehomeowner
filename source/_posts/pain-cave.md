Some people want to have a man cave in their home with a big TV, comfortable seating, and lots of snacks.  I spend more time in the pain cave (also known as a workout room), which a smaller TV, less comfortable seating on bikes and rowing machines, and a few power bars and energy gels that Iâ€™m saving for future events.
