When we bought this house, almost three years ago, we didn't own a lawn mower.  It didn't seem
urgent, since fall was already upon us and the grass wasn't growing as quickly as it had
during the spring and summer.  We didn't even move in until three weeks after closing; we had
the house painted and I did my first big kitchen project in the evenings after work before
the house was fully suitable for habitation.
