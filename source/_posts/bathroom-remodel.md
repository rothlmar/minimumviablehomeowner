I only published two posts before an unexpected life event last year required all my focus, but that event is receding in life's rear-view mirror, but even though the effects will still require attention for the foreseeable future we have resumed moving forward at full velocity.  Just three days after returning from a wonderful holiday vacation, work started on a major remodeling project for the kids' bedrooms and bathrooms.  In the original form, the kids shared two bedrooms, a playroom, and a Jack-and-Jill bathroom. The playroom and the bathroom could only be accessed by going through the bedrooms.  Although we liked this layout when we we're deciding to buy the house, we know that the children will desire more privacy as they get older, so we decided to make some changes.  After repeatedly measuring the space and sketching out options, then meeting with several contractors, we finally figured out a workable plan that should achieve our goals with the minimal amount of changes, work, and expense.
