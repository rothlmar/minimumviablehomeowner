In contrast to the big professional remodel that we undertook upstairs, we have gradually worked on several DIY projects in the garage.  Although the garage isn't on public display, and nobody spends as much time there as in a bedroom, we do transit through it several times every day, so we want it to be pleasant and functional.  The primary purpose of a garage is to serve as storage--for cars and bikes, but also for any number of things that are used rarely, often seasonally.  There is always some tension between questions of of whether we should increase the raw storage capacity, reorganize to be more efficient, or reduce the need for storage by getting rid of things.  So far, we have mostly used the first two strategies, because Jenny does a good job of not letting things get into the garage without a good reason.

That said, before we made too many changes that would result in having more stuff out there, Jenny wanted to repaint. She didn't like the base color or the dingy condition it was in.  I didn't think it would make much of a difference so I wasn't as enthusiastic about the project, but eventually she prevailed, and we spent a couple of weekends and long evenings wiping down the walls and repainting in a basic white.  It didn't take long for me to realize that Jenny's desire was well-founded; the fresh coat of paint really made a difference.  During the bathroom remodel, the plumber decided it was best to cut into the garage ceiling to run the new pipes, and afterwards the workers fixed the drywall and repainted a major section of the ceiling, which we appreciated.
