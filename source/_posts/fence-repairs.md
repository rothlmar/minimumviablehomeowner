Jenny and I have been re-watching *Downton Abbey*; one theme that resonates with me more now is the stewardship obligation Lord Grantham feels towards the estate.  Although it plays out on a much smaller scale, our house has a history that precedes us and a future that will continue after we have moved on, and it is up to us to take care of it in the time that we're here.  Doubtless we will leave to the next owner some amount of deferred maintenance, but we can try to minimize that burden.  Of the projects that we've known about since before we moved into this house, several are still outstanding.  Luckily, there haven't been any sudden events that have caught us off-guard, so we've been able to address them at our convenience.  And this weekend, with an extra day off for Independence Day, I decided it would be a convenient time to fix the fence.

We have a rustic split rail fence on both sides of the back yard, with attached wire fencing that was primarily used to keep the previous owners' dog contained.  Four of the fence posts were leaning precariously due to rotten bases and were kept somewhat upright only by the rails nailed into them and the wire stapled to them.  When we first moved in and had some work done, we asked a handyman service to give us quotes for some other projects including fence repair, and the estimate they gave us for that was high enough that I decided that for what was mostly labor requiring no specialized skills, I would rather do it myself (eventually) than pay that price.  Although there have been times in the last year that I was ready to start the project, appropriate replacement parts are sometimes hard to come by; I don't know if that's because fence repair is a seasonal activity or just that this type of fence has gone out of style.
